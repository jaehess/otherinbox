// MENTORS
// Am I on the right track here?  Here all I'm doing is defining the
// states as I understand them from using the otherinbox application;
// I'm not yet concerned with events and actions.  However, I am anticipating
// some useful external state variables.
//
// I'm continuing to look at the core_oi framework to extract the states from.
